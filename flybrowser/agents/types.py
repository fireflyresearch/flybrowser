"""
Core types and data structures for the ReAct agentic framework.

This module provides the foundational types for implementing the ReAct
(Reasoning and Acting) paradigm with explicit Thought-Action-Observation cycles.

Key Components:
- ReActStep: Complete reasoning step with thought, action, and observation
- Thought: Explicit reasoning with confidence scoring
- Action: Tool invocation with parameters
- Observation: Result from action execution
- ToolResult: Standardized tool response format
- ExecutionState: Agent execution lifecycle states
- ReasoningStrategy: Available reasoning strategies (CoT, ToT, etc.)
